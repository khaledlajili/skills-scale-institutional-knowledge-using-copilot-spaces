# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities

2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager, Scrum Master)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) with Developers and QA/Testing
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) with input from all roles
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (Project Manager, DevOps Engineer)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (Project Manager, Product Manager)
7. UX Designer defines design milestones and deliverables (if applicable)
