# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

OctoAcme runs projects with a lightweight, outcome-focused approach designed to deliver customer value iteratively while maintaining clear ownership and high quality. Work progresses through initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective stages. Teams use a Project One-pager to capture the problem, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and an initial timeline. Planning turns approved initiatives into prioritized backlogs with clear acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done.

Delivery relies on small, testable increments tracked on a project board (e.g., GitHub Projects) with columns such as Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done. Pull request practices emphasize small PRs, linked issues, CI checks (tests and security scans), and at least one approval before merging. Team cadence includes daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and demos at the end of sprints or milestones to keep work aligned and visible.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit: Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communication; Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Developers build and test features; QA validates acceptance criteria; and Sponsors or Stakeholders provide approvals and strategic direction. Clear escalation paths exist for blockers and incidents, moving from team triage to PM to Product Lead and Sponsor as needed.

Quality assurance includes automated unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests run in CI, security scanning, and manual QA for acceptance where necessary. Releases follow documented pre-release and deployment checklists, rollback plans, and post-deploy verifications. Retrospectives after sprints, releases, or incidents capture action items that are tracked in the backlog for continuous improvement.
