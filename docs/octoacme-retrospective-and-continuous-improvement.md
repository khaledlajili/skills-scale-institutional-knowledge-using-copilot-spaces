# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Facilitated by Scrum Master or Project Manager
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Ensure all roles have opportunity to contribute (Developers, QA/Testing, UX Designer, DevOps Engineer, Product Manager)

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Assign owners based on relevant expertise (e.g., DevOps Engineer for CI/CD improvements, UX Designer for design process improvements)
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync or during Scrum Master's process review
